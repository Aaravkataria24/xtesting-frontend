# TweetLab 🐦

A lightweight web app that predicts the performance of tweets using machine learning. Built with React + FastAPI.

🌐 **Live Site:** [xtesting.aaravkataria.com](https://xtesting.aaravkataria.com)

⚠️ **Note:** The backend is hosted on Render and may take ~1 minute to spin up if it's been inactive. Just wait a bit and re-try if the predictions fail initially.

## Features

- Predict how well a single tweet will perform (likes, replies, retweets, and engagement score).
- Split test two tweets and find out which one is likely to perform better.
- Clean, modern UI with instant feedback.
